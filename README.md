# PortfolioAndroidApp
this is my first app on Google Play Store
The portfolio app displays live feed of my profile picture and competitive programming rating from different websites. The App uses clean architecture design (MVVM). Dependencies are injected using dagger hilt, UI is written using jetpack compose, and the profile picture is from firebase live database. The ratings are extracted with a combination of api calls and html parsing.
App apk is in GitHub folder.
